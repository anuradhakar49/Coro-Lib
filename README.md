# Coro-Lib
A repository for deep learning and numerical modelling resources for COVID-19 mitigation.

This repository is intended to allow users to gain first hand experience with applying deep learning models for COVID-19 classification and predictive models for forecasting COVID pandemic scenarios. Details and links to the datasets used may be found in Datasets directory.
This repository will be periodically updated to include new computational resources for mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic.

All coding resources are in Python programming language.
